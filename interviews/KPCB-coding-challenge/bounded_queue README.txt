This folder contains two files other than this:
	1) bounded_queue.py — which implements the class bounded_queue as specified in the assignment. 			2) bounded_queue_test.py —  which tests the bounded_queue class. 

To run the test, change directories to the directory that the two files are in. Then, type:
	
	python bounded_queue_test.py
	
to run the test. That is all there is to it!
